<h2>Sushi Tei presents an authentic Japanese foodie experienceðŸ˜‹ </h2>

    <p style="font-size:20px;" >    
        
        When it comes to food, Bangladeshis are famous gourmands. And like any good foodie, we love to be adventurous about<br>
         food and explore a variety of items. As tastes develop, weâ€™re all about trying new flavours and cuisines in addition to <br>
         our traditional delicacies. One such is example is the recent rise in number of people who are trying out Japanese cuisine. <br>
         However, there are only a few restaurants in Bangladesh that can give their customers the exotic taste of authentic Japanese food.
